# Sense HAT Dreidel
Create a dreidel with a Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT! When you shake the Raspberry Pi, the dreidel will "spin" and land on a random letter.

The code for this project is contained in ```dreidel.py```. Type the code in your preferred Python environment on a Raspberry Pi (with a Sense HAT) running the latest Raspbian release. You do not need to type the comments that explain the code. Comments look like this: ```# I'm a comment. The computer ignores me.``` **No copying and pasting! :-)** 

Have fun! :D
